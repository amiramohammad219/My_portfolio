## Projects

### Project Summary: Global Cost of Living Comparison

This project involved analyzing and comparing the cost of living across various cities and countries worldwide. The analysis was conducted using a comprehensive dataset that included variables such as housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment costs.

### Key Objectives:

To identify the most and least expensive cities for expatriates and locals.
To compare the cost of living between regions, such as North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
To analyze the impact of economic factors like inflation, exchange rates, and income levels on the cost of living.

## Methodology:

### Data Collection: Sourced and aggregated cost of living data from reputable global databases.
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Used Python and SQL to clean and standardize the dataset, ensuring consistency across different regions.
### Analysis: Employed statistical analysis and visualization techniques to compare costs across cities and countries. Key metrics like cost of living index, rent index, and local purchasing power were calculated.
### Visualization: Created interactive dashboards and charts using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to present the findings clearly.

## Findings:

## Significant cost of living disparities were observed between cities in developed and developing countries.
## Major metropolitan areas in Europe and North America ranked among the most expensive, while cities in Southeast Asia and Africa were among the most affordable.Exchange rate fluctuations and inflation were found to have a considerable impact on cost of living variations.
## Conclusion: The analysis provided valuable insights for individuals and businesses considering relocation, enabling informed decisions based on the cost of living in different regions. The project also highlighted the economic factors influencing cost of living disparities worldwide.
